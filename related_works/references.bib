  abstract = {Recently there has been a flurry of research on the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) in wireless networks to create smart radio environments. In a smart radio environment, surfaces are capable of manipulating the propagation of incident electromagnetic waves in a programmable manner to actively alter the channel realization, which turns the wireless channel into a controllable system block that can be optimized to improve overall system performance. In this article, we provide a tutorial overview of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for wireless communications. We describe the working principles of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and elaborate on different candidate implementations using metasurfaces and reflectarrays. We discuss the channel models suitable for both implementations and examine the feasibility of obtaining accurate channel estimates. Furthermore, we discuss the aspects that differentiate RIS optimization from precoding for traditional MIMO arrays highlighting both the arising challenges and the potential opportunities associated with this emerging technology. Finally, we present numerical results to illustrate the power of an RIS in shaping the key properties of a MIMO channel.},

  abstract = {The future of mobile communications looks exciting with the potential new use cases and challenging requirements of future 6th generation (6G) and beyond wireless networks. Since the beginning of the modern era of wireless communications, the propagation medium has been perceived as a randomly behaving entity between the transmitter and the receiver, which degrades the quality of the received signal due to the uncontrollable interactions of the transmitted radio waves with the surrounding objects. The recent advent of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces in wireless communications enables, on the other hand, network operators to control the scattering, reflection, and refraction characteristics of the radio waves, by overcoming the negative effects of natural wireless propagation. Recent results have revealed that reconfigurable intelligent surfaces can effectively control the wavefront, e.g., the phase, amplitude, frequency, and even polarization, of the impinging signals without the need of complex decoding, encoding, and radio frequency processing operations. Motivated by the potential of this emerging technology, the present article is aimed to provide the readers with a detailed overview and historical perspective on state-of-the-art solutions, and to elaborate on the fundamental differences with other technologies, the most important open research issues to tackle, and the reasons why the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces necessitates to rethink the communication-theoretic models currently employed in wireless networks. This article also explores theoretical performance limits of reconfigurable intelligent surface-assisted communication systems using mathematical techniques and elaborates on the potential use cases of intelligent surfaces in 6G and beyond wireless networks.},

  abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have promising coverage and data-rate gains for wireless communication systems in 5G and beyond. Prior work has mainly focused on analyzing the performance of these surfaces using simulations or lab-level prototypes. To draw accurate insights about the actual performance of these systems, this paper develops an RIS proof-of-concept prototype and extensively evaluates its potential gains in the field under realistic wireless communication settings. In particular, a 160-element RIS, operating at a 5.8 GHz band, is designed, fabricated, and accurately measured in the anechoic chamber. This surface is then integrated into a wireless communication system and the beamforming gains, pathloss, and coverage improvements are evaluated in realistic outdoor communication scenarios. When both the transmitter and receiver employ directional antennas, the developed RIS achieves 15–20 dB gain in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in a range of ±60° beamforming angles. In terms of coverage, and considering a far-field experiment with a blockage between a basestation and a grid of mobile users and with an average signal path of 35 m, the RIS provides an average SNR improvement of 6 dB (max 8 dB) within an area > 75 m2. Thanks to the scalable RIS design, these SNR gains can be directly increased with larger RIS areas. For example, a single 1,600-element RIS with the same design is expected to provide 26 dB SNR gain for a similar deployment (theoretical estimation). These results draw useful insights into the design and performance of RIS systems and provide an important proof for their potential gains in real-world far-field wireless communication environments.},

  abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are considered a promising technology for boosting the coverage and for enhancing the spectral efficiency of wireless systems, as well as for taming the wireless environment. The potential benefits of RISs are currently being analyzed and various approaches are being proposed to address the challenges for their integration in wireless networks. Currently available studies to quantify the potential gains of deploying RISs in wireless networks are limited to simple network topologies, while no system-level assessments have been reported to date. Network-level, for example, on the scale of hundreds of square meters, simulations are, however, the first step to quantify the actual value of emerging technologies and the steppingstone before considering large scale system-level experimental evaluations and network deployments. Toward this direction, this article reports the first system-level simulation results and analysis of an RIS deployment in a typical urban city that is served by a fifth-generation cellular network. The obtained system-level simulation results unveil that the benefits of RISs vary depending on the operating frequency and the size of the surfaces. Specifically, we investigate the performance improvement that RISs can provide, in terms of outdoor and indoor coverage and per resource block rate, when deployed in mid (C-band) and high (millimeter-wave) frequency bands. For example, the obtained results unveil that the deployment of RISs enhances the coverage probability from 77 percent to 95 percent in the C-band and from 46 percent to 95 percent (92 percent in the presence of network interference) in the millimeter-wave band.},

  abstract = {Wireless networking plays an extremely important role in civil and military applications. However, security of information transfer via wireless networks remains a challenging issue. It is critical to ensure that confidential data are accessible only to the intended users rather than intruders. Jamming and eavesdropping are two primary attacks at the physical layer of a wireless network. This article offers a tutorial on several prevalent methods to enhance security at the physical layer in wireless networks. We classify these methods based on their characteristic features into five categories, each of which is discussed in terms of two metrics. First, we compare their secret channel capacities, and then we show their computational complexities in exhaustive key search. Finally, we illustrate their security requirements via some examples with respect to these two metrics.},

Although the community has made progress in understanding how the physical layer can support confidentiality and authentication, it is important to realize that there are many important issues that must be addressed if physical layer security is ever to be adopted by real and practical security systems. In this article, I briefly review several different flavors of physical layer security (at least for wireless systems), and then identify aspects (a.k.a. weaknesses) where the foundation for physical layer security needs to be strengthened. I then highlight that the opportunities for applying physical layer security to real systems will be quite rich if the community can overcome these challenges. In the course of the article, I note new directions for the community to investigate, with the objective of keeping physical layer security research targeted at having a practical impact on real systems.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive review of the domain of physical layer security in multiuser wireless networks. The essential premise of physical layer security is to enable the exchange of confidential messages over a wireless medium in the presence of unauthorized eavesdroppers, without relying on higher-layer encryption. This can be achieved primarily in two ways: without the need for a secret key by intelligently designing transmit coding strategies, or by exploiting the wireless communication medium to develop secret keys over public channels. The survey begins with an overview of the foundations dating back to the pioneering work of Shannon and Wyner on information-theoretic security. We then describe the evolution of secure transmission strategies from point-to-point channels to multiple-antenna systems, followed by generalizations to multiuser broadcast, multiple-access, interference, and relay networks. Secret-key generation and establishment protocols based on physical layer mechanisms are subsequently covered. Approaches for secrecy based on channel coding design are then examined, along with a description of inter-disciplinary approaches based on game theory and stochastic geometry. The associated problem of physical layer message authentication is also briefly introduced. The survey concludes with observations on potential research directions in this area.},

  abstract = {The potential of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) for energy-efficient and performance-boosted wireless communications is recently gaining remarkable research attention, motivating their consideration for various 5-th Generation (5G) Advanced and beyond applications. In this paper, we consider a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Physical Layer Security (PLS) system with multiple data streams including one legitimate passive RIS and one malicious passive RIS, with the former being transparent to the multi-antenna eavesdropper and the latter’s presence being unknown at the legitimate multi-antenna transceivers. We first present a novel threat model for the RIS-boosted eavesdropping system and design a joint optimization framework for the eavesdropper’s receive combining matrix and the reflection coefficients of the malicious RIS. Focusing next on the secrecy rate maximization problem, we present an RIS-empowered PLS scheme that jointly designs the legitimate precoding matrix and number of data streams, the Artificial Noise (AN) covariance matrix, the receive combining matrix, and the reflection coefficients of the legitimate RIS. The proposed optimization algorithms, whose convergence to at least local optimum points is proved, are based on alternating maximization, minorization-maximization, and manifold optimization, including semi-closed form expressions for the optimization variables. Our extensive simulation results for two representative system setups reveal that, in the absence of a legitimate RIS, transceiver spatial filtering and AN are incapable of offering non-zero secrecy rates, even for malicious RISs with small numbers of elements. However, when an  $L$ -element legitimate RIS is deployed, confidential communication can be safeguarded against eavesdropping systems possessing even more than a  $5L$ -element malicious RIS.},

  abstract = {The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is envisioned to create ultra-secure wireless networks. Previous works on the RIS-assisted security provisioning techniques assumed wiretap channel information at the transmitter, which is practically unavailable in a passive eavesdropping scenario. In this article, we consider a point-to-point anti-eavesdropping system in which a RIS is used to enable the secure transmission from a multi-antenna transmitter to a multi-antenna legitimate receiver. A passive eavesdropper, whose channel state information is completely unknown, attempts to decode the secret messages. We propose a security approach by using the reflection at the RIS as multiplicative randomness against the wiretapper. Specifically, the reflection coefficients in terms of amplitude and phase are updated in each transmission and kept private at the RIS. Through the reflection designs, the effective channel matrix is diagonalized at the legitimate receiver. In contrast, the eavesdropper receives coupled signals with the weights of the randomness at RIS. The main contributions of this article are three reflection designs and correspondingly three secure transmission schemes, which fulfills diverse requirements of the balance amongst performance metrics including the degrees of randomness, spectral efficiency, and reliability. The main benefits of the proposed secure transmission schemes are four-fold. First, the transmitter does not need to know the eavesdropper's channel states. Second, closed-form solutions for the reflection coefficients are provided. Third, the legitimate receiver has a linear decoding complexity. Fourth, the unauthorized wiretapper is unable to cancel out the multiplicative randomness and thus cannot extract much useful information. Numerical results show that exploiting the RIS as a source of multiplicative randomness provides a new perspective to improve the security of the wireless networks.},

  abstract  = {This paper studies the physical layer security (PLS) of a vehicular network employing a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). RIS technologies are emerging as an important paradigm for the realisation of smart radio environments, where large numbers of small, low-cost and passive elements, reflect the incident signal with an adjustable phase shift without requiring a dedicated energy source. Inspired by the promising potential of RIS-based transmission, we investigate two vehicular network system models: One with vehicle-to-vehicle communication with the source employing a RIS-based access point, and the other model in the form of a vehicular adhoc network (VANET), with a RIS-based relay deployed on a building. Both models assume the presence of an eavesdropper to investigate the average secrecy capacity of the considered systems. Monte-Carlo simulations are provided throughout to validate the results. The results show that performance of the system in terms of the secrecy capacity is affected by the location of the RIS-relay and the number of RIS cells. The effect of other system parameters such as source power and eavesdropper distances are also studied.},
