\section{Introduction}
\subsection{What is Physical Layer Security?}

In telecommunications, we have two type of threats we need to protect against. Active attacks, like jamming a frequency, distrupt and block the flow of information and we need to protect our communications, while passive attacks, like eavesdropping, are more subtle and we need to make our signals undeciphrable with encryption or noise \cite{5751298}. There are different methods we can use to mask our communications: we can fingerprint the legitimate users, add noise to our signal, spread it through multiple frequencies, use directional antennas or artificial noise schemes \cite{5751298}.

The adversaries may also have better resources, both in computer power and signal reception, and it is difficoult to model all possible threats we may face \cite{7120011}.

In particular to eavesdropping, there is a huge opprtunity for improvements. While distruptions have been studied for long, expecially in military communications, message encryption is usually delegated to the higher levels \cite{6739367}. However, the physical layer can assist by hiding or masking the signal, making it harder for the eavesdropper to capture the it. Given the advances in quantum computing and encryption breaking \cite{365700}, it is important to be protected at all layers.

Achieveing perfect communication secrecy in all cases is not really possibile for all cases, given that we need the secret key to be at least as big as the secret message \cite{6769090}, but there are some practical strategies we can implement.

In \cite{7543509} a statistical model is created to calculate the probability of archieving secrecy from eavesdroppers in unknown locations, while in \cite{4543070} and \cite{1605889} it is discussed how we can use the antenna spare power to induce artificial noise to assure the legitimate receiver has better signal.
