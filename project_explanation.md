Both Tasks 2.1 (Directionality-driven security) and 2.2 (RIS-enabled privacy) started with a classic state-of-the-art analysis, aiming at understanding the status of research on the topic of physical layer security (PLS), with a special focus on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). ~~We have identified the following open problems~~

~~TODO: Add Simone research, plus intended lines of research~~

While RIS give us more options and freedom for network communications, they also increase the risk for secure transmissions. With recent breakthroughs in 6G technologies, quantum computing and vehicular networks, we need as much security as possible and digital encryption may not be enough anymore.

Our work with physical layer security aims to make communications safer by hiding signals from potential eavesdroppers. We're studying how to use RIS in two ways: to improve signal strength when devices are not in line-of-sight scenarios, and to add interference that blocks unwanted listeners.

Our research findings have significant implications for autonomous vehicle communications. The high volume of data exchanged at critical points, such as intersections, combined with the potential severity of safety incidents, makes this research particularly urgent as self-driving technology continues to evolve rapidly.
