This paper presents an extension of physical layer security techniques using Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communications. Building upon previous work on secure transmissions, we generalize the mathematical framework to support multiple legitimate receivers and complex RIS configurations and combinations, including parallel and in series reflections. Our approach maintains low error rate for legitimate users while ensuring high levels of artificial noise for eavesdroppers, preserving security through Space Shift Keying (SSK) modulation. Extensive simulations analyze Bit Error Rate (BER) performance across various scenarios and demonstrate that our framework achieves robust security and relaiability. Our simulations include realistic channel modeling, incorporating Rician fading and different path loss calculations, and presents them through BER heatmaps. The proposed framework offers promising applications for emerging technologies requiring secure communication, such as vehicular networks and Internet of Things, without introducing the latency overhead of complex encryption schemes.
